### What do I want this application to do?
1. Show how money I have using some type of graph
    - Split into different categories (Savings, checkings, cash, other)
2. Shows various budgets for different categories
    - For each budget, show how much I have spent within that budget and how much is left
    - Have different views of all budgets with the ability to look at individual budgets
        - *A pie chart that shows the total budget with each category*
        - *Ability to choose a budget on the pie chart to further investigate the progress*
        - *Other views I'll think about later*
3. Progress made towards big purchases
4. Page to set budgeting goals
5. Page for doing scratchwork
